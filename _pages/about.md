Hi! My name is Zixiao Zhao. I'm currently a PhD student in the School of Computer Science in the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html), under the supervision of Associate Professor [Jing Sun](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/jing-sun). My research topic focuses on Auto-Software Engineering for Medical Image Processing.

I'm also a PhD representative of CS department. We are organizing our CS PhD Pizza Lunch Seminar, check [our website](https://sites.google.com/view/csphd?pli=1) for previous and upcoming talks and all other information.

I speak Mandarin (mother tongue), English (C1), French (B2) and a little Spanish.
